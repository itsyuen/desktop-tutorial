This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub repo.

This is my first GitHub desk top tutorial version control practice.

I am now using VS code on windows 11, located on my Dell Pro laptop to start my git/github c/c++ coding experience!!!
I am also connecting MATLAB on my win11/Dell Pro with GitHub repo, also digging into MATLAB projects to syn it into a standard Git/Repo integration as this becomes a very large project in the future.

Test for change using a commit editor inside vs code.
Test for change using version control tool inside matlab.
Test for change using git CLI: git status, git pull, git commit -m, git push . (notice the push all command line option....)

Imported the .md file from repo, and used it to preview it directly here on Hackmd.io
